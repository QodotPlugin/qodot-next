# Qodot Next

## A next-generation successor to Qodot, written in GDNative Rust

Qodot Next is a full rewrite of the original GDNative release of Qodot, and acts as the Godot engine integration for the Quarchitect library.

It's presently in alpha testing stage; the core is there, but needs some polishing and testing before it can be considered done.

### New features

- Natively-parallelized parsing and geometry building processes
- Overhauled editor integration and resource system
- WAD3 support
- Support for taking .map files by godot resource or file path
- Support for searching textures by resource location, global file path or WAD
- Rebuild-on-change support for resource-based maps
